## How-to-play?

You have fallen in a software breach!
The goal is to find your way back to the surface of the game.
For this you need to jump with the SPACEBAR, move your avatar with LEFT and RIGHT arrows...

If you manage to catch a super-jump bonus, press the UP arrow to use it!
You can only have 3 super-jumps at the same time, one of each color.

Have fun!
